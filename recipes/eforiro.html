               STEPS
            </h3>
          <ol>
              <li>First, get your core  ingredients ready. Efo Riro is a fast cooking dish,
                 so you’ll need to be proactive.image <br><br>
            
                imageNow, season the meats, add sliced onions and boil on medium heat. 
                Remember to boil the tougher meats first, then add the softer ones.
                 Just before it’s fully cooked, add the Stockfish, boil till tender and set aside. <br><br>
                
                Sorry, I haven’t got photos of the meat prep process
                 cos I usually boil my meats in bulk and store for future use.
                
                Wash your vegetables thoroughly with hot water 
                to rid it of all traces of dirt, be careful not to
                 in soak in hot water for too long so as to retain 
                 the nutrients. Slice or chop according to your preference and 
                 set aside. <br><br>
              </li>
  
              <li>Blend the scotch bonnets and bell peppers and 
                an onion coarsely and set aside…image
                Into a large pot, add the palm oil, leave to hea
                t up on medium heat for 2 minutes ….imageThen add onions, fry till fragrant.image
                Then add the locust beans, fry to release the 
                flavour for another minute…. <br><br>
                Now add the blended pepper and two Knorr cubes,
                 let that fry for 15-20 minutes thereabouts or 
                 until the pepper dries out and 
                the size reduces by almost half….imageThe 
                consistency should be thick as pictured below…. <br><br>
              </li>
  
              <li>Add a bit of the meat stock/ chicken stock, 
                if you haven’t got stock, just add water, 
                be careful not to add too much. Just one cup should do.image
                Let it boil for 2-3 minutes to combine, 
                then add the assorted meats, prawns, crayfish, stockfish and catfish.
                Combine and taste, adjust seasoning if required. 
                Leave to cook for a further 10 minutes. <br><br>
                Now add the washed vegetables, combine thoroughly…image
                Switch off the heat at this time, 
                leave to simmer for a further 5 minutes with the residual 
                heat and it’s ready.Efo Riro Serve with any “swallow” of your choice. 
                Efo Riro is also prefect with white rice, boiled yam and plantain.Efo Riro <br>
