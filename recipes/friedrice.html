  <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Prep and Cook Rice
             1. A great vegetable fried rice recipe begins with well-cooked white rice. 
             To do so, first,
             soak 1 cup of basmati rice (190 to 200 grams) in water for 30 mins. 
             Then drain and set rice aside.
          
             Tip: You can opt for a good quality 
             aged long-grained rice if you do not have Basmati rice.
             Jasmine rice will also work in a pinch.
          </li> <br>
          <li> In a large pot add 4 to 4.5 cups of water,
               ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 to 3 drops 
               of toasted sesame oil (or any cooking oil),
                and set over high heat on the stovetop.
          </li> <br>
          <li>Let the water reach a full boil,
          </li> <br>

          <li>Add the soaked and drained basmati rice</li><br>

          <li>Simmer the rice uncovered on medium to medium-high heat.</li><br>

          <li>Cook rice until al dente, or just about cooked.
               It’s important that you do not overcook rice during this
                step in order to make the best Chinese fried rice dish.
               Overcooking rice or even cooking them completely, 
              will break the rice grains while stir-frying.
             </li><br>

          <li>Quickly strain rice in a colander, 
              and let it cool completely at room temperature.
               Refrigerating rice for 30 minutes also helps.
                Simply cover cooked rice and refrigerate.
             </li><br>

          <li>You can also rinse the rice with water so that the rice stops cooking.
               Use your hands to gently stir the cooked rice grains around while
                rinsing to ensure that every grain is cooled. Then drain thoroughly.
             </li><br>

          <li> Cover cooked rice and set aside to cool</li><br>
          <li> While rice is cooling, finely chop the veggies.
               Because french beans tend to be tougher
                than the other mixed vegetables,
                I recommend chopping them very finely.
               You also have the option to blanch them first before adding,
               or you can begin cooking them in this recipe before the rest
                of the vegetables are added.
         </li><br>

          <li>For my favorite version of fried rice recipe you will 
              need ¼ cup of each of the following ingredients, finely chopped:
          </li><br><br>

          <li>spring white onions (scallions) (not in the image below)</li>
          <li>carrots</li>
          <li>french beans</li>
          <li>capsicum (bell peppers, your choice of color green, red or yellow)</li>
          <li>Plus about 1 cup of chopped button mushrooms for great earthy,
               umami flavor.</li><br>

           <li>I also like to include 1 tablespoon of
               finely chopped celery for the most authentic Chinese-inspired dish.
           Include ¼ to ½ cup of chopped cabbage if you have them.</li><br>

          <li>Now it’s time to stir-fry the vegetables.
               Start by heating 3 tablespoons of preferred
                cooking oil in a wok or a deep skillet.
                Add 1 whole star anise and fry for a few seconds, 
                until the oil becomes fragrant.

              If you do not have star anise, 
              simply skip adding it and move to step 12.
              
              Tip: Use a good, trusted, heavy pan, skillet, 
              or wok for stir-frying so that the tender fresh veggies 
              do not get stuck or burn when frying at medium to high heat.
               Use oil having neutral taste and flavors.
          </li><br>

          <li>Then add 1 teaspoon of finely chopped garlic,
               and ½ teaspoon finely chopped ginger.
               Cook for only a moment as you don’t 
               want to brown or burn the garlic.</li><br>

          <li> Add the chopped spring onions, and sauté 
              for a minute or two on medium-low to medium heat.</li><br>

          <li>Then add the finely chopped french beans or,
               add these before the onions 
               if you want a softer bean texture.</li><br>

          <li>Continue to stir-fry both the onions
               and french beans for 2 to 3 minutes over 
               medium to medium-high heat.</li><br>

          <li> Now add the remaining finely chopped veggies, 
              including mushrooms and celery.
               Increase the heat to high to thoroughly
                cook all of the ingredients.</li><br>

          <li>Continuously toss and stir while frying so that
               the veggies are uniformly cooked and do not get burnt 
               for about 4 to 6 minutes.
               You want the vegetables to be cooked
                and fried but still retain some great crunch.</li><br>

          <li>Once the veggies have cooked, 
              add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Stir and mix well.

           Tip: You can add less (1 to 2 teaspoons) 
           or more (about 2 to 3 tablespoons) soy sauce if you prefer that. 
          I recommend going for naturally brewed soy sauce or tamari.

          Note: If you do not like or prefer soy sauce, 
          then omit it adding to the dish.</li> <br>

          <li>Taste the dish, and then add ½ a teaspoon 
              of ground black pepper and as much salt as you like.

              The Chinese fried rice will already
               be slightly salty because of the soy sauce,
               so not much additional salt should be needed.</li><br>

          <li>Mix well to combine the flavors.</li><br>

          <li> You are now ready to put everything together
               to make the veg fried rice. 
              To the wok or skillet of veggies 
              add the cooked and cooled rice 
               1 cup or so at a time.</li><br>

          <li>Reduce the heat to medium or medium-high.
               Use a spoon or spatula to gently fold 
               cooked rice into the mixed vegetables</li><br>

          <li>With the heat still on medium to medium-high,
               continue to gently mix and fry the 
               vegetables with rice for a couple of minutes.</li><br>

          <li>You now have the option to stir in
               1 tablespoon of rice wine or rice vinegar 
              (or other mild vinegar), 
              if you like. This adds a terrific 
              note of sourness to the fried rice 
              that isn`t necessary but is quite lovely</li><br>    

          <li> Lastly, add more fresh chopped spring onions. 
              You can either sprinkle on top as a garnish 
              or mix into the fried rice to incorporate.</li><br>

          <li>Serve Veg Fried Rice hot by itself for a
               light yet hearty meal,
               or enjoy it as a side dish along with
                your other favorite Chinese recipes</li><br>

          <li>It stays good for about a day in the fridge. 
              But I would recommend it to be eaten as soon as
               you make it  a few days old rice is not good for health. </li> <br>
