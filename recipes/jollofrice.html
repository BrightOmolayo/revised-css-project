    <div class="intro">
        <p>Jollof, or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa.
          The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, 
          tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot,
          although its ingredients and preparation methods 
          vary across different regions</p>
     
         <p>The recipe is simple enough. 
             I made it even more simple by cutting it down to just 5 easy steps.
              As long as you have the main ingredients and you season appropriately,
               then your jollof should come out perfectly.
              I usually serve it with some baked chicken, 
              salad, and fried plantains. Enjoy!!</p>

                STEPS
              </h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, 
                      scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor
                       or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure
                        that everything is blended well.</li><br>
                        
                  <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat.
                       Once the oil is heated add the onions you set
                        aside and fry just until they turn golden brown.
                      Once the onions, have turned brown in color add 
                      the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add
                       the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside)
                        and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes.
                       Make sure you stir consistently so 
                       that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li><br>
          
                  <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, 
                      and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings 
                      (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, 
                      and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li><br>
          
                  <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew.
                       At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level
                        with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. 
                      Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes</li><br>
          
                  <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover,
                       and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes
                        heat until the liquid has completely dried up.
                       Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly,
                        and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li><br>
          
                  <li>Note: It is key to use parboiled rice so that
                       you don`t end up with mushy rice in the end.
                      When cooking the tomato stew, you can tell when 
                      it is done because the oil will rise to the top.
                       Also another way to tell that is done is when the 
                       bitter taste of the tomatoes has been cooked out.
                        The reason why you reserve 1/4th of the tomato mixture
                         and add it at the end is because we do not want the rice to burn.
                          Also, it gives the rice that beautiful red color we all know and love.
